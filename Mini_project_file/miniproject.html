<i><p style="">Mahendra Singh Dhoni, popularly known as MS Dhoni, is a former Indian cricketer and one of the most successful captains in the history of Indian cricket. Born on July 7, 1981, in Ranchi, Jharkhand, Dhoni is known for his calm nature, sharp mind, and exceptional leadership skills. He led India to many historic victories, including the 2007 T20 World Cup, 2011 ODI World Cup, and the 2013 Champions Trophy.

Dhoni is also famous for his lightning-fast wicketkeeping and his powerful finishing abilities as a batsman. Under his leadership, India reached the No. 1 spot in Test cricket rankings. Apart from international cricket, he captained Chennai Super Kings (<abbr title="Chennai Super Kings">CSK</abbr>) in the <strong>Indian Premier League (IPL)</strong> and won multiple titles.

He retired from international cricket on August 15, 2020, but continues to inspire millions with his journey from a small-town boy to a cricketing legend.</p></i>

<h2 id="about">Early Life</h2>
<ul>
    <li><p>Mahendra Singh Dhoni was born on July 7, 1981, in Ranchi, Bihar (now Jharkhand), into a middle-class family. From a young age, he showed a keen interest in sports, especially football and badminton, and served as a goalkeeper for his school team at DAV Jawahar Vidya Mandir. His transition to cricket happened when his coach spotted his quick reflexes and encouraged him to try wicketkeeping. Despite coming from a region with limited cricket infrastructure, Dhoni worked hard, trained daily, and traveled long distances for matches. He balanced his studies with his love for sports and remained focused on improving his game. His early life was marked by discipline, passion, and strong support from his family and coaches, which laid the foundation for his remarkable cricket career. 

In his childhood, Dhoni was known for being quiet, focused, and physically active. At school, he was not just good at sports but was also respectful, disciplined, and popular among his classmates. Once introduced to cricket, Dhoni quickly became a star performer for his school and local club teams. He joined the Commando Cricket Club in 1995, where he played for three years and sharpened his wicketkeeping and batting skills. His aggressive batting style, even at a young age, stood out and earned him recognition in local cricket circuits.</p></li>
<li><p>
Dhoni played in junior-level tournaments like the Vinoo Mankad Trophy and impressed selectors with his fearless hitting. However, it wasn‚Äôt easy‚Äîhe was from a non-metropolitan city, and getting noticed by national selectors required consistent hard work. Dhoni never gave up, often practicing long hours, and at times, he worked as a ticket collector (TC) with Indian Railways in Kharagpur to support himself and keep his cricket dream alive. This phase taught him time management, patience, and how to stay grounded.

His early life story is a perfect example of how dedication, humility, and perseverance can turn a small-town boy into one of the world‚Äôs most respected cricketers.

<h2 id ="class">First-Class Cricket</h2>
  <p>
    MS Dhoni began his first-class cricket journey playing for Bihar, which later became Jharkhand after the state split. Despite coming from a region not well known for producing cricketers, Dhoni impressed with his powerful batting and consistent performances. He played key innings in the Ranji Trophy and other domestic tournaments that showcased his natural talent and fearless approach. His breakthrough came during the 2003‚Äì04 season, after which he was selected for the India A team. His performance on the tour to Kenya and Zimbabwe made headlines, leading to his eventual selection into the Indian national team in 2004.

Dhoni‚Äôs first-class career laid the strong foundation for his future success as India‚Äôs legendary captain.</p>

    international debut in 2004 against Bangladesh.</li>

    <li>MS Dhoni‚Äôs journey to Indian cricket is a story of perseverance, talent, and determination. Starting from Ranchi, a city not known for producing cricketers, Dhoni worked his way up through school and club cricket. He made his mark in domestic cricket while playing for Bihar and later Jharkhand, showcasing powerful batting and sharp wicketkeeping. His big break came during the 2003‚Äì04 India A tour to Kenya and Zimbabwe, where he scored heavily, including two centuries against Pakistan A. His fearless style caught the attention of selectors, and in December 2004, he earned his maiden call-up to the Indian national team.</li>
    <li>MS Dhoni‚Äôs rise to Indian cricket is nothing short of inspirational. Born in Ranchi, Jharkhand, Dhoni initially focused on football and badminton before turning to cricket.

Dhoni consistently performed in the Ranji Trophy and other domestic tournaments. His breakthrough came during the India A tour of Kenya and Zimbabwe in 2004, where his explosive batting ‚Äì including a 148 against Pakistan A ‚Äì made national headlines. Impressed by his potential, then Indian captain Sourav Ganguly and selector Kiran More backed his selection. Dhoni made his ODI debut against Bangladesh in December 2004. Though he was run out for a duck in his first match, he quickly bounced back with a century against Pakistan in just his fifth ODI, cementing his place in Team India.</li>
